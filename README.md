# GenAI Stuff

This is a dumping ground for small genai-related scripts and data
files.

* sd-dynamic - CLI wrapper to use the popular
  [dynamicprompts](https://github.com/adieyal/dynamicprompts)
  library with image-generation software that doesn't support
  it directly.

* aspect.py - calculate resolutions for arbitrary aspect ratios that
  do not exceed the "standard" (squared) pixel count for a model.

* waifupaper.py - MacOS wallpaper-rotation script with more
  options than the standard control-panel settings.

* randompeople.yaml - dynamicprompts wildcards converted from a
  [heavily-randomized prompt](https://discord.com/channels/1243166023859961988/1396143088560242708)
  posted to the SwarmUI Discord channel by user Hippotes, with
  some typos corrected and some weights added. Use as __p/random__.
